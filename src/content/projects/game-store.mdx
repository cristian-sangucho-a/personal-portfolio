## üåü Project Overview

The **Game Store** project is an interactive **Java EE** web application that lets users browse, purchase, and manage their video game library. With this platform, users can:

- **Discover Games:** Easy browsing and filtering of games to match user preferences.
- **Smooth Transactions:** Effortlessly add games to your cart and proceed to secure payment options.
- **Manage Purchases:** Once a game is purchased, it is automatically moved to the user's personal library for future access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

The project leverages a full-stack approach with the following technologies:

- **Java EE & JSP**: The core of the application, providing a robust back-end and dynamic front-end.
- **JPA (Jakarta Persistence API)**: For managing and persisting game and payment data.
- **MySQL**: The database that stores video game and payment information.
- **Maven**: For managing project dependencies and building the project.

## üìö What I Learned

### Agile Development with SCRUM

The project was developed using the **SCRUM framework**, helped me improve my skills in:

- **Sprint Planning**: Breaking down large features into manageable tasks for each sprint.
- **Backlog Management** Organizing and prioritizing work items, which allowed the team to focus on the most valuable tasks first.
- **Team Collaboration** Daily stand-ups and sprint retrospectives ensured that all team members were aligned..

### DevOps Implementation

- Automated build process with Maven (3.3.2)
- CI/CD pipeline featuring:
  - JUnit test execution gate
  - WAR artifact signing
  - Azure Web App deployment

### Testing Infrastructure

- **JUnit 5**: Parameterized tests for service layers
- **Mockito**: Behavior verification for repository layers

### DevOps Toolchain

![Cofiguration on Azure DevOps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cristian-sangucho-a/cristian-sangucho-a/main/media-projects/game-store-devops.gif)

- Azure Boards for sprint planning (12 user stories completed)
- **Azure DevOps**:
  Azure DevOps was the central tool used to implement SCRUM and DevOps practices.

  - **Azure Boards**: Used to manage the project backlog, create user stories, and track progress across sprints.
  - **Azure Repos** A cloud-based repository for version control, ensuring that code was properly versioned, and changes could be tracked and managed efficiently.
  - **Azure Pipelines**: Set up for **CI/CD**, automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
  - **Retrospectives**: The tool helped us reflect on completed sprints, identify areas for improvement, and iterate on our processes.

## üöÄ Engineering Insights
