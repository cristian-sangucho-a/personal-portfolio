![City Services Reservation Module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cristian-sangucho-a/cristian-sangucho-a/main/media-projects/city-services.gif)

## 🌟 Project Overview

**City Services** is a **municipal engagement platform** that transforms how citizens interact with their local government. It empowers users by providing them with easy access to a variety of services. The system enables:

- 🏙️ Municipal informational channels
- 📅 Mass event attendance control
- 📝 Citizen reports for addressing issues
- 🔧 Managing reports for local authorities to respond and take action
- 📲 Notifying citizens about report or updates
- 🎉 Organizing large public events to promote civic activities
- 👥 Group activity organization by reserving communal spaces

## 🚀 Feature Developed

This feature helps citizens **organize group activities** by reserving communal areas.
The reservation can be **public** or **\*private**, and you can manage an **invitation list**.

```gherkin
Característica: Realización de actividades por ciudadanos
  Como entidad publica
  Quiero que los ciudadanos realicen actividades en mis espacios publicos
  Para mejorar la convivencia entre los ciudadanos
```

It's a great way to foster community engagement while ensuring that citizens have the tools they need to plan events smoothly.
