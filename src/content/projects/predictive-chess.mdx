## üåü Project Overview

**Predictive Chess** is an interactive Java desktop game where players can visualize
potential moves by clicking on a piece. Players can easily see where each piece can move
next by simply clicking on it, makings the game more accessible and enjoyable.

## Features

- **Highlight Possible Moves** Highlights possible moves for selected pieces.
- **Graphical User Interface** Intuitive GUI for playing chess.
- **Classic Chess Rules**: All traditional chess rules are implemented.
- **Save and Load Games** Ability to save and load chess games.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Java**: The core language used to implement the game logic, utilizing **Object-Oriented Programming** principles for clean and modular code.
- **Swing**: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI), providing an interactive and responsive desktop application experience.

## üìö What I Learned

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Strengthened my understanding of **OOP** by applying it to a real-world application, organizing the game logic into manageable and reusable objects like pieces, boards, and moves.

### Desktop Application Development

- Gained hands-on experience with **Swing**, improving my ability to create interactive desktop applications.
